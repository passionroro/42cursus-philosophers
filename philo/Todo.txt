in include/philo.h
- add in t_data an array of unsigned long called last_meal_time

in init.c
- malloc, initialise to 0 and free

in routine.c
- everytime a philo eats, change the value of last_meal_time[id-1] to current_time()
- philo_is_alive : checks if the difference between current_time and last_meal_time is superior to time_of_death
- find a way to exit all the threads at the same time 
- philo_is_alive could directly return philo_detroy if the philo is dead
- to destroy a philo : mutex destroy
